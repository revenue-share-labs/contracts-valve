Detailed documentation for each contract can be found [here](https://github.com/xla-rsc/contracts-valve/tree/main/docs/contracts).

Deployment instructions described in [Deployment.md](scripts/Deployment.md)

## Summary

1. The main ideas of RSC Valve SC is to redistribute tokens (whether they are ERC-20 or native cryptocurrency), to the participants based on the percentages assigned to them.
   - Percentages may have up to 5 decimal points.
   - The sum of all percentages must always be equal to 100% percentageSum == 10000000
1. Every native cryptocurrency sent to this contract address will be redistributed according to the rules either in real-time or manually, as determined by setting the isAutoNativeCurrencyDistribution to true of false.
1. Every ERC-20 token must be manually redistributed using the redistributeToken() method.
1. The contract must always redistribute 100% of the tokens between recipients, and it is not possible to have a contract without recipients or with less than 100% shares assigned.
1. The distribution of native cryptocurrency and ERC-20 tokens can only be done by the one of the distributors. Distributors can be added or removed by the owner. However, native cryptocurrency distribution can be done by anyone if isAutoNativeCurrencyDistribution is true.
1. The recipients addresses controlled with two roles: owner and controller. Controller has the ability to set recipients addresses and set immutable recipients flag. Owner also can set immutable recipients, but can't change/set recipients addresses. Setting immutable flag makes further recipients changes impossible.
1. Controller can be changed only by the owner of the Valve contract.

## Actors and use cases

- owner → Address that has the capability to set the distributor / controller and set immutable recipients;
- recipients → Addresses which will receive redistributed currency or ERC-20 tokens according to percentage;
- distributors → Addresses which can distribute ERC-20 tokens locked in contract;
- controller → Address which can set recipients;
- factory → Address of the factory that was used for contract creation. It is used for getting platformWallet which receives Fee from contract usage;
